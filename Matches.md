**8.8.2023: Todor:** A good talk and yet another proof that FEP (Free Energy Principle) is another wording of some of the core discoveries of the Theory of Universe and Mind by Todor Arnaudov, then a teenager, originally 2001-2004, first publications in Bulgarian in the e-zine "The Sacred Computer".
It was taught during the world's first University courses in Artificial General Intelligence, offered by the same author in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria.

Before that the TOUM was presented also in front of a general audience as early as 2009, once briefly mentioned  regarding the building block of intelligence - for Jeff Hawkins that was the cortical column, and for me in my theory: **"Universal simulators of virtual universes"** during a 3-minute presentation, titled "My story in AI", performed on the stage of theater "Sofia" during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgmsH21k3lI">Famelab final event</a> in May 2009. 
The second time was a long lecture at the Technical University of Sofia in September 2009, with a promotional title <a jref="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2009/09/event-with-me-in-sofia.html">"The Time Machine Exists: The Mind"</a>:, and the slides' title was: 
**Principles of General Intelligence:<br> Intelligence ~ Universe** (the precise word in Bulgarian was Разум (Razum), it means all: (General) Intelligence, Mind, Consciousness:

### How the Razum works? Hierarchical self-organizing predictor of the future - a scientific performance | AGI event of mine in Sofia

I will have a scientific performance where I will explain the architecture and the principles of operation of the Razum (Mind, General Intelligence), their organic connection with the architecture and the way of working of the Universe and the brain, 
and how on that basis me and other researchers plan to create thinking machines.

(В научна шоу-програма ще обясня архитектурата и принципите на работа на разума, органичната им връзка с архитектурата и начина на работа на Вселената и мозъка, 
и как на тази основа аз и други учени смятаме да създадем мислещи машини.)

After that lecture I gave an interview for the magazine called "Obekty" titled:
<a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-will-create-thinking-machine-that.html">"I will Create a Thinking Machine that will Self-Improve (an Interview with Todor): Dreamers and adventurers make the great discoveries. The scepticists' job is to deny their visions, and eventually not to believe their eyes"</a>
where I also mention these principles as the way AGI will be created and I made a prediction that there will be significant breakthroughs to basic AGI/general models in less than 10 years.

### Concrete matches from the content of the video

* For example the concept in TOUM which seems analogical to FEP's Markov blanket is the Causality-Control Unit (Управляващи устройства, подвселени, въображаеми вселени, подмашини и др.) - also virtual universe, machine, subuniverse, universes at different levels. 

* The ambiguity of the boundary of the Markov blankets in FEP maps to two foundational concepts from TOUM: resolution of perception and resolution of causality-control and one postulate, that the only "real" causality-control (actual, and not "virtual" in that narrow sense) is the one where the control unit predicts (causes, controls) the target controlled unit with the resolutions of perception and control which are equal to the highest possible ones at the universe where the target CCU exists and operates. I.e. if it fully causes and generates it. Usually that is impossible, except for the Universe as a whole: the global "generative model". Humans, human's "consciousness" for example controls (predicts) a ridiculously tiny bandwidth regarding intentional causation, i.e. muscular motions. 

* As of the boundaries - everything, the selection process, which belongs to what, is decided upon selected resolutions from both modalities and other parameters, it's a filter which depends on the observer-evaluator. This is the same like feature selection. 
* The law that the mentioned "dynamo" mathematician has discovered, regarding bigger Markov blankets being more predictable -- was one of the foundational generalizations from the early TOUM. The biggest "Markov blanket" (Casuality-control unit, Virtual Universe) is the whole Universe and it supposedly predicts and "knows" the future with the highest possible certainty: P=1, however it happens at the highest possible resolution only, at the machine language of the Universe at the lowest level (in the view to the Universe as a Computer, as that's one other name of TOUM: The Universe Computer). The subuniverses' predict at lower resolution and/or lower range, however they can predict many steps ahead (counted at the lowest time clock). The evolution (the development) of the Universe is directed towards the creation, agglomeration, expansion, extension of ever bigger causality-control units which resemble the whole/the Universe, their function is to predict the future with ever higher precision, scope, range etc., the final aim is P=1, as the whole Universe, this is their limit as in Calculus. Computers are examples of such virtual universes and human mind also converges at mathematics and computer-like operation at its highest conscious levels.  One of the basic insight and logic in one of the early works was that the laws of the random numbers actually suggest determinism, or more "objectively technically definite": a global "observer", in my terms it would be also an "evaluator"(observer-evaluator) - the Universe as a whole has to watch all events and balance them so the random numbers distribution are always aligned with the target value (with some precision). That happens because the events are connected, they are generated by some common generative algorithm and they interact. Note that "events" could be very abstract or linked between many levels of the hierarchy of causality-control units ladder (it is not always strictly hierarchical, it is heterarchical): quarks-protons/neutrons, electrons, atoms, parts of molecules/molecules, macromolecules, cell organelles , systems of them, cell, tissues, organs, systems of organs, organisms, groups of organisms (and some abstract "parts" of these systems which can't be physically cut, but they could be theoretically induced by modeling the interactions and behaviors...) etc.  That theory is not over, "Universe and Mind 6" is coming. The example of Max about the engines is exactly as one of my first comments in 2018 when I first heard of FEP (from Friston's Wired interview and from a short article in Wikipedia): that was mine comment regarding a paper called "Ultimate AI" by a follower of K.Friston:

>2. CogAlg and Free Energy Principle
>I asked the owner of the CogAlg project Boris about his opinion, he said that he's been hearing about that theory "at least from a decade" and in short he didn't seem impressed, because it was "nothing novel".

>As of myself, I think the explicit emphasis of the idea of reducing the space of states for the living organisms and intelligence is suggestive for people who face these ideas for the first time, however it's somewhat obvious for hierarchical systems and even simple "machines", as the gears, the pistons etc. serve as "sub-spaces" which limit and guide the space of possible states.

>As defined in the most ancient basics of "my theory", the higher level patterns are constructed by selected sequences/sets of elements from the lower level which serve as "instructions" (discrete), therefore not all possible combinations are covered. Only a limited space is legal, which respectively reduces the search/combinatorial space of possibilities at the higher level, therefore it has "a reduced space". That's seen in the hierarchical structures in nature: atoms, molecules, cells, tissues etc.

>That "free energy principle" is yet another proof that the general direction towards AGI are getting established in different domains by different researchers.

Etc. (I'd like to comment on "every line" and all matches, but I didn't have an opportunity when I first listened to the record and these comments are by memory).
