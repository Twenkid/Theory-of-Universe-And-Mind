## Predicting the Generative AI since the early 2000s

From https://emergingmarketsconsulting.com/verses-ai/ slides 8-9, 14-11-2023:

_Generative AI referred as "generative"  for its ability to reverse engineer a dataset, recognize and extract any pattern, style, form, or function that the data contains... can algorithmically generate any image, sound, object, or scene, digitally rendering it as text, audio, video, org graphics, in 2D or 3D. It can even code it into software or 3D print it.."_

Thoughts about the Artificial Thought

## Creativity is imitation at the level of algorithms

A possible, sketchy development path for the Artificial Intelligence "Emil"

Ideas on the "Emil" project, 24.4.2003 - 4.5.2003

Naming the trials

Разновидностите, представляващи предписания, подражаващи на човешкото творчество, вероятно ще се именуват така: "Емил, опит 1", "Емил, опит 2" и т.н. или Емил-1, Емил-2,..., Емил-246...,...; или: 1,2,3,4,5; вероятно ще имат и "човешки" имена: "Пускач", "Помощник", "Звуков господар", "Музикант", "Благозвучник", "Рисувач", "Изобразител", "Съчинител", "Олицетворенец", "Стихоплетец", "Познавач", "Ликопомнец", "Шегобиец", "Приказливец", "Преводач", "Търсач", "Подреждач", "Бърборко", "Играч на...", "Чистач", "Красноречив", "Словозаврънкулковец" и каквото друго хрумне, докато се стигне до целта - можещ всичко "Творец"

Varieties representing prescriptions that emulate human creativity will probably be named: "Emil, Experiment 1", "Emil, Experiment 2", etc. or Emil-1, Emil-2,..., Emil-246...,...; or: 1,2,3,4,5; they will probably also have "human" names: "Launcher", "Helper", "Soundmaster", "Musician", "Soundman" ["Harmonysounder", Благозвучник], "Painter/Drawer/Artist" [Рисувач], "Illustrator", "Composer", "Impersonator", "Poem-weaver", "Connoisseur" [Познавач, Recognizer], "Face Rememberer", "Prankster/Joker", "Talker", "Translator", "Searcher", "Storer/Orderer", "Chatter", "Player of...[games]", "Cleaner", "Loquacious/Orator", "Inventor of new interesting complex words/Words creator" [Словозаврънкукловец, a neologism] and whatever else comes to mind until the goal is reached - an all-powerful "Creator".

Guidelines for Emil's development

The first programming attempts (it is not clear when the first attempts will appear) will perhaps be simple creators of (for example):

- sentences
- conversations
- poems
- short incidents in speech
- sounds
- music
- images

- 
Creators will learn by perceiving imaginary objects - information entities (also called scrolls) in the form of words, sound, images, different formats of arithmetic scrolls (file formats). Creators will look for dependencies [correlations] between submitted scrolls, collect the scrolls (or part of them, due to naturally limited memory) and the found dependencies in their memory. Using what they have learned, they will create new works.

The "machine haters" and deniers of Artificial Intelligence "defend" their position with a statement that sounds roughly like this: "a machine could never create original, because it will always repeat what has been put into it by man, or at most imitate him ". Of course it's true.

**Creativity is imitation. But imitation at the level of ALGORITHMS. Different minds use different INPUTS to their otherwise SIMILAR ALGORITHMS and DIFFERENT OUTPUTS result - ART, for example. The "stronger" reason is, the more transparent this truth becomes for it, on which it itself rests, the better reason separates, e.g. the styles in art - SIMILAR ALGORITHMS regardless of using different inputs - eg. the particular thing drawn. The essence of reason, according to "the author of these thoughts" (oh, that's a cold way of expressing it... let me "warm it up").**

**In my opinion**, one of the main essences of reason (just as I was wondering what "reasonable input" is, it dawned on me) is **RECOGNITION OF ALGORITHMS.**

Man also imitates - there is no other choice, because in order to create, the mind must know what to create, goals must be set for it from somewhere, which as a consequence lead to creativity, to thinking.

Man has senses through which he gets to know the world, understands what is "required of him". By birth, the human mind is not even a mind, but only the embryo of one (see below), and it takes time to learn what it is supposed to imitate.

In the language of "Emil" , the algorithm that introduces works and looks for dependencies in them is called "seed of reason" (ZR). (See also "Man and the Thinking Machine" (Analysis of the possibility of creating a Thinking Machine and some shortcomings of man and organic matter in front of it) , magazine "The Sacred Computer" no. 13, Dec. 2001)

The germ/seed of reason is, for example, the human brain when it is in the body of a newborn child.

According to "Emil's" understanding so far, the creation of Artificial Intelligence consists in finding a "viable germ/seed", ie. a sufficiently complex initial algorithm capable of collecting any other algorithms and information of any kind and using them to improve its work.

The "seed of reason" itself does not need to show signs of intelligence as soon as it is "born", precisely because it is an embryo and not a "ripened" intelligence. Through training in a sentient environment, however, the embryo is able to "mature" into a sentient being. One of its abilities is to output information similar to the input. If it is fed "reasonable input" it will output that too. Let's emphasize, similar, not the same. What does "reasonable input" mean? 

The question is complicated because there is no clear definition of "reason", so we are not "clear" what we should be answering.
It easily occurs to me, however, that one possible answer would be to ask what "similar" means.

The answer is now simpler:

Similar information entities can be described by repeated or similar ALGORITHMS. E.g. the tests of the power of reason are tests of its ability to find algorithms - dependencies.

The Seed of Reason uses the environment as a means of procuring algorithms and data. The human body gains access to the environment through its senses (senses, sensors, sensors). For a Seed of Reason constructed as a prescription for a computer, the senses are also programs.

In general, creators will represent attempts to produce "germs/seeds of intelligence" .

Let us again briefly describe roughly what we mean by "germ/seed of intelligence/reason":

A SEED OF REASON, SR: Coherent underlying algorithms that learn and execute new algorithms. For the work of the algorithms, for their "feeding", non-algorithmic memories - data - are also accumulated.

The purpose of "Reason", or "Emil" (many names can be used - for variety) is, as the experiments develop, the embryos become more "responsible" - their creativity can respond better to the input information; to better adapt to the art examples and worlds in which they are taught to exist; to answer direct inquiries...
 
In order to arrive at the Goal - intelligence comparable to human, the different types of creators must begin to flow into each other and gradually merge completely.

"Reason" is still a "fellowship of one man" seeking like-minded people trying to unravel thought.

## **"How would I invest a million with the greatest benefit for the development of the country? - Interdisciplinary research and creative institute | Interdisciplinary Research Institute", 6.2023:**
**
An excerpt, Google Translate:

Original source (from the former geocities): https://www.oocities.org/todprog/ese/proekt.htm
Plovdiv, June 2003

In my opinion, a powerful future source of revenue, for which 1 million euros is an excellent start, because the key to making it happen is in the human brain, is the Thinking Machine (MM). A machine equal to or surpassing human intelligence would become an unprecedented engine of scientific research and culture in the country that first managed to create it. (...)
The machine will be able to be a programmer, of course. If given the opportunity to explore her device in detail, once created, she could assist in improving it to the limits provided by the particular "hardware" on which her computer "soul" universe resides. MM can go even further - the "soul" could refine the "body" - the "electronic flesh", until physical limits are reached. In this role, the Machine will work as an electronic engineer looking for new circuit solutions; a physicist perfecting current technologies for the manufacture of integrated circuits and nanotechnology, or a discoverer of as-yet-unknown ways of building machines.
I believe that it is only a matter of years until we find the right "parts" and build a "machine" from them to overcome the "Wall" and meet the Machine.

**STRATEGY**

**According to my strategy, a scientific-research Institute would be founded, which would unite computer scientists, engineers, art critics, linguists, philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists; multilingual translators; creators in various arts - writers and poets, composers and musicians; artists, photographers and film directors. The members of the Institute will be, with advantage, having knowledge and skills in several fields, both scientists and creators, because the goal of the searches will be to discover the commonality between all manifestations of reason, between the sciences and the arts. The form of thought is different in different manifestations of thinking, but its essence, the underlying mechanisms, are the same, and only the data with which it works [change] - word[s], sound, images, sequences of images, abstract concepts and etc.**

The institute will also play the role of a "wing" that finds, "protects and wings" gifted people to support their development and, if they wish, to enjoy their talent in research.

The Institute will have a program house, in which "incidentally" "smart" application software will be produced, using the developments of the Institute on the way to IR: programs for automated design, multimedia, word processing, translators, games, etc. application programs.
The goal of the Institute will be the programmatic creation of a MM, possessing universal capabilities for exchanging information with other computing machines, in particular robotic modules. The robots created by the robotics department will be, in addition to a way to use IR for physical activities, a means of attracting public attention and advertising for the Institute.

Once a Thinking Machine is realized, it will be able to be used in all creative spheres of human activity and in the work of the Institute itself.
I suppose that after the Discovery and the creation of the MM, running on standard computers, the Institute will be "armed" and will be able to set aside a design department to develop new complete computing systems specially adapted for the operation of the Machine.

* October 2013: **"Creative Intelligence will be First Surpassed and Blown Away by the Thinking Machines, not the "low-skill" workers whose jobs require agile and quick physical motion and interactions with human-sized and human-shaped environment"**

(...)

_The bottom line is that the "white collars" are more endangered in current-time economy.
Perhaps that kind of economy could hardly survive the AGI revolution.
I guess it may turn inside-out for a while - the low-skill workers could get higher pay, because [the] intellectual activities will be done in 1 ms for free... ;)_
