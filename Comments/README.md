Regarding Hofstadter claim that the AI progress was not expected or predicted, how surprised he was, he expected it to happen after hundreds of years or so.
Many top researchers also admit that they didn't expected the progress, incluyding Y.Bengio and G.Hinton, Irina Rish etc.

The progress in AI was expected and predicted, by pioneers such as me myself, but not by him and many others who surprisingly didn't understand what intelligence was (BTW, Goedel's incompleteness is a nonsense in regard to AGI, see "Theory of Universe and MInd" or an upcoming article from me, "Universe and Mind 6", or listen to Joscha Bach). The fact that so deep thinker (supposedly) thought that composing music was sort of "magical", "machines couldn't do it" (they tell a story about D.H. reaction on a composing machine) suggest that he actually didn't understand these processes and creativity per se. In a piece of my "Theory of Universe and Mind" (2001-2004) from a 2002, I discussed with a philosopher who now seems to have had the same confusions as D.H. He also thought and argued that machines couldn't compose or create music or art, because they "didn't have a soul" and other nonsenses, while I told him that creativity is just prediction and plausible correlations, the machines will discover that same harmonies and structure as humans, and the music was already exhausted even then (it was and it is, if one is good enough in understanding its structure).
