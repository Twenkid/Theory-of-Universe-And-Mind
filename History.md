[That's a quickly drafted documents, it needs editing etc., but I can't spend enough time.]

* The original classic works were published between 2001-2004, first publications were in Bulgarian in the e-zine "The Sacred Computer", mentioned in a 3-minute presentation for general audience in Sofia in May 2009, presented to general audience in a lecture in Technical University of Sofia in September 2009, taught in the syllabus of the world's first University courses in Artificial General Intelligence, offered by the same author in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria. 
* See more in the main page and additional comparisons and comments to other works in "Matches" etc.

* The TOUM was mentioned in the 3-minute presentations regarding the building block of intelligence, in a comparison with Jeff Hawkins's one: the cortical column, and for me in my theory: **"Universal simulators of virtual universes"**. The presentation was titled "My story in AI", performed on the stage of theater "Sofia", it was filmed and you can see it in this video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgmsH21k3lI">Famelab final event</a> in May 2009. 

* The second time was a long lecture at the Technical University of Sofia in September 2009, with a promotional title <a jref="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2009/09/event-with-me-in-sofia.html">"The Time Machine Exists: The Mind"</a>:, and the slides' title was:

**Principles of General Intelligence:<br> Intelligence ~ Universe** (the precise word in Bulgarian was Разум (Razum), it means all: (General) Intelligence, Mind, Consciousness:

### How the Razum works? Hierarchical self-organizing predictor of the future - a scientific performance | AGI event of mine in Sofia

I will have a scientific performance where I will explain the architecture and the principles of operation of the Razum (Mind, General Intelligence), their organic connection with the architecture and the way of working of the Universe and the brain, 
and how on that basis me and other researchers plan to create thinking machines.

(В научна шоу-програма ще обясня архитектурата и принципите на работа на разума, органичната им връзка с архитектурата и начина на работа на Вселената и мозъка, 
и как на тази основа аз и други учени смятаме да създадем мислещи машини.)

After that lecture, in October 2009 I gave an interview for the magazine called "Obekty". It was titled:

## Todor Arnaudov: I will Create a Thinking Machine that will Self-Improve:
### Dreamers and adventurers make the great discoveries. The scepticists' job is to deny their visions, and eventually not to believe their eyes
<a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-will-create-thinking-machine-that.html">"I will Create a Thinking Machine that will Self-Improve (an Interview with Todor): Dreamers and adventurers make the great discoveries. The scepticists' job is to deny their visions, and eventually not to believe their eyes"</a>
where I also mentioned these principles as the way AGI will be created and I made a prediction that there will be significant breakthroughs to basic AGI/general models in less than 10 years (see the Transformer).
Note that in 2009 there was no an adopted evidence for that and even in 2023 we can hear experts in podcast admitting that they "no one expected it" and **they** in particular were surprised by the speed of progress and that "so simple principle" will be so powerful; "just next word prediction" (more precisely: next token, not "word"), "just a giant hash table", "just linear algebra" - if we enumerate the diminutive definitions. **("It" is not "just that", see "Unvierse and Mind 6")**

Well, next token prediction is not surprising if one understands it: in order to predict the next token for a wide context window and a long history of input, the system must have an appropriate, adequate world model, be it implicit. For example the powerful Image generators, already "the obsolete" ones such as DALL-E/Bing Image creator apparently have an implicit ray-tracing and/or global illumination representation and simulation.
Also the predictions have to be consistent on various scales, ranges and sub-structures and super-structures/micro-macro, which forces the representation to map them.

As of the time of the predictions: the Imagenet breakthrough with the CNN's by AlexNet happened in late 2012. The AGI colleagues Demis Hassabis and Shane Legg, founders of Deepmind, complain that around the late 2000s, probably also early 2010s, when they created "DeepMind" (in the autumn of 2010), you couldn't get a cent for doing AGI research, the other researchers "roll-eyes and leave" and the professors warn you that "you were mad" and "you were suiciding your carreer".
In brief: this was not obvious, except for the visionaries, which I call also "prophets" in my book "The prophets of the Thinking Machines: Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism: History, Theory and Pioneers".

"<b>Obekty: If you believe that it's possible for us to build an AGI, why we didn't manage to do it yet? What are the obstacles?</b>

**Todor Arnaudov, 2009:** I believe that the biggest obstacle today is time. There are different forecasts, 10-20 years to enhance and specify current theoretical models before they actually run, or before computers get fast and powerful enough. I am an optimist that we can go there in less than 10 years, at least to basic models, and I'm sure that once we understand how to make it, the available computing power would be enough. One of the big obstacles in the past maybe was the research direction – top-down instead of bottom-up, but this was inevitable due to the limited computing power. For example, Natural Language Processing is about language modeling; language is a reduced end result of so many different and complex cognitive processes. NLP is starting from the reduced end result, and is aiming to get back to the cognitive processes. However, the text, the output of language, does not contain all the information that the thought that created the text contains.

On the other hand, many Strong AI researchers now are sharing the position that a “Seed AI” should be designed, that is a system that processes the most basic sensory inputs – vision, audition etc. Seed AI is supposed to build and rebuild ever more complex internal representations, models of the world (actually, models of its perceptions, feelings and its own desires and needs). Eventually, these models should evolve to models of its own language, or models of human's natural language. Another shared principle is that intelligence is the ability to predict future perceptions, based on the experience (you have probably heard of Bayesian Inference and Hidden Markov Models), and that intelligence development is improvement of the scope and precision of its predictions.

Also, in order the effect of evolution and self-improvement to be created, and to avoid intractable combinatorial explosion, the predictions should be hierarchical. The predictions in an upper level are based on sequences of predictions (models) from the lower level. Similar structure is seen in living organisms – atoms, molecules, cellular organelles, cells, tissues, organs, systems, organism. The evolution and intelligence are testing which elements are working (predicting) correctly. Elements that appeared to work/to predict are fixed, they are kept in the genotype/memory, and are then used as building blocks of more complex models at a higher level of the hierarchy.

Note that there is no explicit border and division between the physical particles and the living organisms.

I participated with this essay in a prestigious essay competition in 2003, aged 18. I claim and the history proved that the essay was brilliant, more than brilliant, a prophecy, but it wasn't selected even in the top 20 which went to a further selection/
The goals and the method were applied by "DeepMind" and mny of the proposals were immitated by institutes around the world since 2017 and still are called "new", "radical", "original", 20 years after I clearly defined them and the 20-years late world wasn't intelligent enough to notice.

Excerpts, Machine translated, Google translate, 10.8.2023:

In my opinion, a powerful future source of revenue, for which 1 million euros is an excellent start, because the key to making it happen is in the human brain, is the Thinking Machine (MM).

     A machine equal to or surpassing human intelligence would become an unprecedented engine of scientific research and culture in the country that first managed to create it.
     
      An expressive example of the potential of MM is the huge information flow through its memory, which can be managed down to binary. Man is capable, for a second, of outputting conscious information that is described by several tens of bits. This applies to speaking, singing, typing, moving the mouse pointer, drawing, playing a musical instrument. In the same second, an ordinary personal computer transfers, through its central processing unit alone, a billion times the information over which the machine has complete control. If such a powerful "stream of information" is controlled by reason, the "calculating hardware" will turn into an amazingly perceptive student, who would quickly become a prolific artist in all arts and a tireless scholar. Connected to robotic bodies, in the design of which, in fact, she could also participate, MM will be able to perform physical activities, to give a "friendly arm" to man and industry in the literal sense.
      
        Since the MM's personality would be recorded as pure information - on computer media that could be overwritten and stored theoretically forever, unlike the human carrier of the personality - the brain, a machine trained to some degree could be reproduced simply by switching on a copy of her personality in a new "body" where she can begin to develop independently and learn only what is necessary for the new activity. All the sensible experience possessed by any previous MM will be readily transferable to another who will have the personality of her "mother" at birth.
        
      Thanks to MM's mind being able to have a direct high-speed connection to a computing machine - processors from MM's own body, or another machine to which MM is electronically connected as a user - computer design, modeling and, generally speaking, creativity, handed to the Machine, will be done much faster than
man does. All input and output devices will be part of the "imagination" of the MM, therefore much faster than the currently mandatory moving, equivalent to inert and slow human input devices.

      The machine will be able to be a programmer, of course. If given the opportunity to explore her device in detail, once created, she could assist in improving it to the limits provided by the particular "hardware" on which her computer "soul" universe resides. MM can go even further - the "soul" could refine the "body" - the "electronic flesh", until physical limits are reached. In this
role, the Machine will work as an electronic engineer looking for new circuit solutions; a physicist perfecting current technologies for the manufacture of integrated circuits and nanotechnology, or a discoverer of as-yet-unknown ways of building machines."

(...)

I believe that it is only a matter of years until we find the right "parts" and build a "machine" from them to overcome the "Wall" and meet the Machine.

**STRATEGY**

According to my strategy, a scientific-research Institute would be founded, which would unite computer scientists, engineers, art critics, linguists, philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists; multilingual translators; creators in various arts - writers and poets, composers and musicians; artists, photographers and film directors. The members of the Institute will be, with advantage, having knowledge and skills in several fields, both scientists and creators, because the goal of the searches will be to discover the commonality between all manifestations of reason, between the sciences and the arts. The form of thought is different in different manifestations of thinking, but its essence, the underlying mechanisms, are the same, and only the data with which it works - word, sound, images, sequences of images, abstract concepts and etc.
The institute will also play the role of a "wing" that finds, "protects and wings" gifted people to support their development and, if they wish, to enjoy their talent in research.

The Institute will have a program house, in which "incidentally" will be produced "smart" application software using the developments of the Institute on the way to IR: programs for automated design, multimedia, word processing, translators, games, etc. application programs.
The goal of the Institute will be the programmatic creation of a MM [Thinking Machine], possessing universal capabilities for exchanging information with other computing machines, in particular robotic modules. The robots created by the robotics department will be, in addition to a way to use IR for physical activities, a means of attracting public attention and advertising for the Institute.

Once a Thinking Machine is realized, it will be able to be used in all creative spheres of human activity and in the work of the Institute itself.
I suppose that after the Discovery and the creation of the MM, running on standard computers, the Institute will be "armed" and will be able to set aside a design department to develop new complete computing systems specially adapted for the operation of the Machine.
