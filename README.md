# Theory of Universe and Mind or "The Bulgarian Prophecies"
Todor Arnaudov's "Theory of Universe and Mind", originally created in 2001-2004, a general "theory of everything", unifying Cybernetical Digital Physics Cosmology and Evolution with (Artificial) General Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind. A forefront of other analogical theories by top minds. Part of "The Bulgarian Prophecies" in AGI, Philosophy of AI, Digital physics etc. The theory was taught in the world's first interdisciplinary course in Artificial General Intelligence in 2010, 2011 at the University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

Jeff Hawkins' "On intelligence"/Memory-prediction framework, Karl Friston's "Free Energy Principle"/"Active Inference", Joscha Bach's discussions on Universe and Mind in podcasts up to now, 2022-2023 ( in many aspects, except a few details about "existence" and "real", almost identical to the ones and the reasoning expressed bellow, 20 years earlier), Michael Levin's "Scale-Free Cognition" etc. are analogical or isomorphic, similar or closely related in philosophy to these "prophecies". 
 More detailed comparisons and display of the matches to come.
