# Theory of Universe and Mind or "The Bulgarian Prophecies" in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Digital Universe/The Universe Computer, Philosophy of AI and Mind, A unification of Universe, Mind, Computation, Evolution, AI etc. 2001-2004 etc.

Todor Arnaudov's "Theory of Universe and Mind", originally created in 2001-2004, a general "theory of everything", unifying Cybernetical Digital Physics Cosmology and Evolution of the Universe with (Artificial) General Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind and mapping to human behavior, motivation, reinforcement learning, society (...). It is yet a little known predecessor of many other analogical, related and similar theories, which are recently getting more elaborated and scientific, supported with technical papers and promoted by world renowned researchers. I discovered Karl Friston's "Free energy principle" theory in late 2018 and Michael Levin's work as late as late February? 2023 and their ideas are still cutting edge in 2023.

Due to the predictions and the large number of matches of future works to the claims, ideas, hypotheses and the reasoning to the works from "Theory of Universe and Mind" (ToUM) and some related works, I recently called them also "The Bulgarian Prophecies" in AGI, Philosophy of AI and Mind, Digital physics etc., together with a strategical essay/proposal from 2003 for the development of AGI via the creation of a super interdisciplinary R&D institute. The "prophecies" are Bulgarian both because my nationality and because they were originally written in Bulgarian and the theory was taught during the world's first interdisciplinary course in Artificial General Intelligence in 2010 and 2011 at the University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria with working language Bulgarian (note the MIT's AGI course led by Lex Fridman was in 2018).

A "bibleically" sized documentary book, demonstrating, justifying, proving the "prophecies" is in a final preparation: *"The prophets of the Thinking Machines: Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism: History Theory and Pioneers"*. It is currently in Bulgarian, about 1350 pages ready, a lot of documentary/comparison material to include which may extend it to 14xx or 1500+ depending on the selection. It had a complete version as early as 2020 when I started, but then it was about 800-something pages.

* Please see the works below and the comparisons and matches to later works by other authors. Parallel texts, citations etc. Some matches are evident even from the first pages and the summaries of some ideas, compared to the summaries and the first points from works from ToUM, e.g. see Azarian's 2022 book and the beginning of "Concept about the Universal Predetermination Part 3", 2003, points 0. and 1. 

* As there was nobody to properly review or perhaps understand these works back then, I consider all these later coming matches as a sort of delayed indirect reviews and confirmations, done independently by all these top researchers, which I view as a proof of my correct direction, generalization capability, reasoning, claims, conclusions, hypotheses, logic, way of thinking, models, predictions etc.

However as these works were not published in an academic environment - I was a teenagers: a school boy, at the end of that period: a freshman in "Computer Science" at The University of Plovdiv and I practically had neither peers, nor leaders or supervisors - and I am not in a proper "normal" hierarchy of affiliation, I am looking for readers, scholars, prospective partners for doing future research and development together to become modern reviewers in order to get this body of work and these numerous matches acknowledged.

## Analogical, isomorphic, similar or closely related to these "prophecies", serving as delayed reviews and "confirmation", are for example (detailed lists and discussions to be completed):

* Jeff Hawkins' "On intelligence"/Memory-prediction framework
* Karl Friston's "Free Energy Principle"/"Active Inference"
* Joscha Bach's discussions on Universe and Mind in podcasts up to now, 2022-2023 - in many aspects, except a few details about circular word plays about  "existence" and "real"-ness, are almost identical to the ones and the reasoning expressed bellow, 20 years earlier
* Michael Levin's "Scale-Free Cognition" framework,  “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME): an experimentally-
grounded framework for understanding diverse bodies and minds" (2022), Cognitive lightcone" ... See also #1. 
* Reinforcement learning directions and frameworks; constraints such as bounded rationality in multiagent systems, in the "prophecies" mapped and proven by their match in the interdisciplinary context such as society, states etc.
* Directions for "the future"/"next decade" etc. of AI/Deep Learning (as of 2022-2023) such as compositionality, multiscale, multiresolution, multiagent bounded rationality etc. - suggested in the 2001-2004 prophecies right from the start
* Causality instead of probability-only modeling
* The theories about Mind, (general) intelligence as hierarchical prediction of the future sensory input and motor outputs (causation) (generative models, models of the world etc.); for "minimizing the prediction error" (Friston's "Free energy principle/Active infrence"), the multi-scale operation of these principles, the problem for segmentation of the systems (Friston's "Markov Blanket") etc. are analogical/isomorphic
* The theory in Bobby Azarian's book "The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity" - https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Reality-Organizes-Consciousness-Complexity/dp/1637740441#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Romance%20of%20Reality%20is,systems%2C%20in%20a%20grand%20ballet declared as radically new and ground breaking for science, as it suggests that Universe is evolving to "Omega point" and it is not random, has similar discoveries, conclusions and generalisations. For example compare the intro on the page of the book at "Amazon"  just with the intro and points 0. and 1. from the work _"Concept about the Unviersal Predetermination", Part 3, 2003_: https://research.twenkid.com/agi/2010/en/Todor_Arnaudov_Theory_of_Universe_and_Mind_3.pdf   https://www.oocities.org/eimworld/3/25/pred-3.htm
* Boris Kazachenko's "Cognitive Algorithm or "CogAlg" project (the short name was given by me in 2010) - incremental discrete hiearchical prediction and pattern-discovery by gradual clustering
* Stephen Wolfram's computationalist views and Digital Physics, the computational irreducibility, truth as construction and not binary logic, intelligence being in a continuous space with computation etc., the discrete view towards intelligence/representability "symbolically" ( see e.g., "Computational evolution and human progress", 8.5.2023: https://youtu.be/gRK1cdeRUv0  @10 min, @15 min etc. with Lex Fridman at MIT, see also "Vectors of Cognitive AI" with Joscha Bach and 9.5.2023; with Lex Fridman #4, e.g. ab. 1:35 h - support for the tendency towards generalisation/generalists for humans, "no more Phds" and many other matches of ideas:: https://youtu.be/PdE-waSx-d8
* Yosha Bengio's "Consciousness prior" (2017-2018+) is analogical to the notion and emphasis in ToUM of the very low consciously controlled bandwidth and the causal and low resolution representation in the higher linguistic representation level. An example of Bengio with dropping an object and predicting that it will drop with a very high certainty, but not the precise position/trajectory is the same as an example from the beginning of "Universe and Mind, Part 4", which however has a broader message: it demonstrates what Bengio does: that mind, or "consciousness" or the highest level causality-control unit in a human can cause and predict exactly, with probability one, at its level and resolution of causality-control and perception and mind aims at that, however it actually doesn't cause-control the lower levels of representation which are more closer to "reality" and, as demonstrated, actually are supposed to have more real "control" as of bandwidth (the latter involves also the topic of "free will" which is an important theme in ToUM). See even "Man and Thinking machine", 2001, discussing the low human bandwidth and the other works. 
* "All intelligence is a collective intelligence" - as Levin and others now discuss today. That was discussed starting from "Man and Thinking Machine",2001: that current human intelligence is a result of the work of the whole Universe, and in man/machines segmentation, the end result of the work of all previous generations of humans and technology. A single man, starting from scratch in the wild without any human technology would not achieve much more than an ape.

Compare the intro to note 269 with the intros of the colleagues which were quoted from the panels below, and mine: [Translated with Google Translated and a few corrections/word choices/multiple words]

* 269 **In general, those who do not understand - unable and unwilling to understand magnify the "mysterious" and emotions; and those who can and want to understand - reason, the management of things. The latter also have emotions - like all animals - but they see them as something obvious and elementary, because even animals have feelings - they are at the base of the pyramid. On the other hand - the spectrum of the mind has a huge scope and not everyone has reason; he is the blade of progress - the top of the pyramid.** The first understand - know - only that they do not understand a given object of study, more specifically why this or that happens, with a sufficiently high resolution and in terms related to their volitional behavior (not the will in the Holy sense) - whether what is happening it's up to them, whether it's controllable, etc. (104) The latter understand the object of study as well as understand that they understand it and systematically increase the resolution, clarity and scope of understanding as prediction/anticipation. (104)
These guidelines are related to the perception of the concept of "free will". (103)(104)
The second type lean towards Hegel's definition, expanded by Engels in "Anti-Dühring" (267.1) and quoted by Lenin in "Materialism and Empiriocriticism" (268), and thought also by philosophers and mathematicians such as Laplace, in also by Schopenhauer (235)(236) - in the latter as the increasing distinctness of the higher forms of objectification of the will. In T.Arnaudov's (103)(104) the evolution of the universe is a drive to create imaginary universes of a higher level, which are increasingly better at foreseeing the future - knowing the laws of the sub-universe in which they exist, as well as their own - of their internal working/mechanisms/processes.
This type of thinker often has a broad knowledge of the private sciences, mathematics, combines the humanities and exact sciences and has a bias towards Systems Theory, Cybernetics. (...)

**Other specific discussions which address ideas from The Theory of Universe and Mind**

These are illustration of looking into current discussions and noticing similarities, matches, common themes etc. with ToUM. There could be a huge list of such matches. A few which I watched these days:

* Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 3, 4.5.2023:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klK_L73wLKk
* See ~ 41 min, where Mark Solms ("who is known for his discovery of the brain mechanisms of dreaming ..." from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Solms) after discussing fear and pain, argues that the Qualia is the measurement of the free energy (Friston), i.e. the difference to the expected input. https://youtu.be/klK_L73wLKk?t=2518 In his works Levin links the concept of "stress" at all levels to the difference to the expected/wanted/desired. At 44:50 Levin says "...100% correct". Compare with ToUM, where "pain/suffering" is explained as difference to the expected, it is valid even in "mundane" cases such as why people are uncomfortable when e.g. somebody didn't put off his hat where he is supposed to do it, such as in a church, or when somebody doesn't obey the rules they do obey, even if the rules are obviously "non-functional" and "abstractly" nobody should be hurt *physically* or suffer if they are broken, because they are just a convention: however people do suffer when the rules, their expectations, the justice etc. are broken, either regarding abstract conventional social relations, interpersonal relations or undesirable surprises and let downs (unmet expectations, the sensory input, or the perceived sensory input mismatches the expected/wanted/target, or wrong predictions). The "pain" seemed to come from the not-obeying the rule, not from the essence/material of the rules themselves. See e.g. "Concept about the Universal Predestination/Predetermination II, or Letters between the 18-years old Todor Arnaudov and the [43-years old] philosopher Angel Grancharov" from ToUM. Compare it also with the summary in the slides from the world's first university course in AGI, Plovdiv 2010,2011, which addresses two kinds of reewards: Cognitive and Physical. 
 "CCU" below stands for Control-Causality Unit, also Causality-Control Unit (the same meaning, or maybe a nuance could be added).

See also this simple generalisations about what embodiment is/could be from an AGI design POV: 
**"Embodiment is just coordinate spaces, interactivity and modalities - not a mystery", Arnaudov 2011**: https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2011/12/embodiment-is-just-coordinate-spaces.html
The bullet points there are:

- Known fixed basic continuous coordinate spaces  ...
- Interactivity ...
- Modalities ...
- Inter-modalities ...
- Value-free initial inputs  ...
- Basic reward-system ...

That is a claim that this view implies that this type of embodiment could apply for all kinds of systems, not just "brains" with particular properties, as long as they navigate these spaces. "Continuous" here rather means "connected" in my digital-universe representations. The basic reward system are the "physical"/sensual rewards/goals, i.e. preservation and existence in the lowest level representation, as not securing this would lead to deletion of the higher levels as well. 

Regarding the ceasing of existence of the higher levels of representations when erros - disallowed states, gross mispredictions, mismatches from the expected/controlled future  happens, - see the short work "Abstract Theory of the Exception of the rules in Computers. A theory about the control units and the control", 2004, where with control I also mean "causation", the simplest form of causation for a computer is to store a particular desired "value", state, memory content, to another "subuniverse"/causality-control unit as it has expected/predicted, and in order to be "real"/true causation-control, it has to happen with the resolution that is the highest for the target virtual universe etc. Both computers and the virtual worlds and levels of causation-control and representation and and Mind are part of the "Universe Computer", different levels/kinds of virtual causality-control units, "subuniverses", universal simulators of virtual universes, "systems". In Friston's terms maybe "Markov blankets".

We discuss error-correcting codes (a little; more next time), reductionism, multi-scale controls, and more_
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_413APB9PIw 

Where **Richard Watson** begins with that _he is trying to, or he'd like to develop a theory that links together cognition, evolution, adaptation, development and computation ... "just those", and in particular ... in a way that explains agential behavior and how mechanistic processes at a given level of organization can be more or less autonomous at that scale, but how that interacts with the scale above and below ... He's been excited recently with resonance as a form of error correction and as a mechanism that links together all of those things that he is interested in and its connection to error-correctinng codes is one of the topics that ... could be a good place to start ..."_  [Richard Watson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Watson_(author) ? ]

**Michael Levin**: _Chris, say what you've been and what we've been working on ...?_

**Chris Fields** answers: _"we've been interested in this intersection of physics and cognitive science and biology and how to develop theoretical frameworks that are based very firmly in physics and connect in a very natural way to computer science and that ... provide a nice formulation of what's going on in biology, but complementary to that we're interested in how to import biological and cognitive thinking into physics in a kind of whole scale ... physics is fundamentally **a theory of communication between agents who have some computational structure** and who have to exist within an environment that exerts selective pressures of one kind or other... of course the environmnet in this case is an agent also, that has its own agenda ... and the free energy principle provides a nice way of formulating all of this, especially when t's translated into Quantum information language..."_ 

Map this to the view to Universe as a Computer/Information/Data, Information theory. A funny coincidence in the "prophecy" mode/interpretation is that my High School specialty was "Communication Technology" (Съобщителна техника).

Then M.Levin at 6:50 min: _"Chris and I have been developing lately is perspectives on all this kind of stuff ... centralizing the role of the observer ... everything is from the perspective of some Observer so ... all that Chris said on that topic reference frames and then The Observers and everything would be super important..."_

ToUM addresses this topic of the Observer as an "Evaluator" (Оценител) - in order to emphasize that it is not just observing, but the "Observer" (The Evaluator) evaluates, decides the value, interprets etc. and the interpretation is highly dependent on the Evaluator (analogical to "subjective" in more humane/ordinary life sense). The more developed Evaluator (a Mind or "Consciousness", Causality-control unit, a system) can interpet/evaluate what it observes more freely and is more indirect, it is less directly "forced" to convert the sensory data/feedback into immediate "executive" code, also the more developed/advanced/powerful Evaluator/CCU etc. is better in predicting and causing the future in higher resolution and precision and range etc. See for example the beginning of "Universe and Mind 4", 2004.

**Mark:** _I'm a neuroscientist, trained in the early 80s - frustrated by how little mind there was those days ... the most interesting thing about the brain, namely its mental functions seemed to be treated in a very desiccated way ... so --> psychoanalysis ... took seriously the subjective experience of the mind ... then ... trying to reconscile the two, to build bridges ... to bridge the vast Chasm between those two disciplines ...  in recent times ... I've been always interested in brain mechanisms of consciousness ... in recent times I became convinced of the view that we shouldn't be using a higher cognitive forms of Consciousness as our model example we should be looking to much more rudimentary processes ... from a neuroscientific point of view we should be starting there um with these fundamentally homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the effectively_ valenced raw feelings ... so I became interested in the free energy principle and active inference framework more

**Chris:** _originally trained as a physicist, .. then a degree in philosophy and then went to work in the Human Genome Project, so I'm a sort of elapsed physicist, elapsed philosopher and an elapsed molecular biologist all together ... spent a lot of time in the private sector, not doing science at all..._  ... _Damasio's book https://www.amazon.com/Books-Antonio-Damasio/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAntonio+Damasio  ... read Mark's "Frontiers" paper a couple of years ago ...

Near the end of the panel, discussing bonding, M.L. tells that he's argued with friends of his father and people from his generation, who have said they wanted to have humans as companions, not machines, but he has argued that they actually wanted a _"spiritual bond"_, as humans don't actually care or know what's under the skin, that there are organs etc., they want some kind of relationships, common goals and direction etc. I've argued about the same in the works in ToUM (some of them are fiction) and later works, e.g. that the thinking machines is actually the most similar being to us from the POV of general intelligence, Reason, and because the thinking machine by default has the "materialistic soul" - a personality, a representation of herself - and that what humans call a "soul", in their mind, is actually a simulation of the causality-control unit they associate with a particular person, themselves or somebody else, and they by default lack the capacity to simulate the organs or the atoms. Also, when we communicate, either via an electronic medium or even with letters or other signs, we do not have a "native" sensory experience from the "basal" type, but we still act and feel as if we're talking to the "real" person, the voice could be of somebody else or it could be just a recording (and a "real person" can be a twin or an avatar), and people obviously do bond with characters from books, fairy tales, toys, movies and stories in general, they could love and miss characters from their dreams, and people bond *even with their weapons* - as I argued also in a 2012 letter to an Oxford's institute: <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2012/02/philosophical-and-interdisciplinary.html">Philosophical and Interdisciplinary ">Discussion on General Intelligence, AGI and Superintelligence Safety and Human Moral | Cognitive Origins of the Concepts of Human Soul and its Immortality | Free Will and How it Originates Cognitively | Animate Being and Soul and the Cognitive Reason for the Believe that "Thinking Machines can't have a Soul and Consciousness" | Technology Making us more Humane | The Egoism of Humanity | And more</a>, 2/2012
As argued in the letter, the division "man vs machine" is wrong, it's "us" vs "you", if the "Artilect Wars" happen, IMO they would be either rather as Hugo de Garis renders it: Cosmists with universal thinking machines vs "Anti-thinking-machines" (who will however also would use "machines", but will have them "more aligned"), or more likely: Humans-with-machines vs Humans-with-other-machines, as it's always been. 

The common of the above with which humans "bond" is actually their own self. All other beings, all others' "souls", "spirits" and models of coherent personality and identity are actually predictive models in the evaluator/observer's mind, we "bond" with different "threads" running in ourselves, in our own computational machinery - whatever its "real" representation and substrate is.

## More detailed and exhaustive comparisons and display of the matches and differences to come. ... 

One current note on the M.Solms paper cited above, I skimmed it now as I write this (15.5.2023) and I read it more thoroughly in the next days: IMO the notion of "consciousness" and "consciousness" are confused: IMO many aspects and phenomenons which the psychologists/psychoanalists use to call "subconscious" are actually just another form and a part of the territory of the consciousness.

The levels of accessibility to different parts of that mental space vary per individual and in time, as well what "declarative" is. Also regarding the therapies, in my experience, observations, exploration, reasoning a lot of the emotional problems, difficulties, hard times are actually induced from physical reasons, bad health, which once solved leads to lighter emotional sufferings. A healthy man could not suffer a lot for a girl who he's lost, while one who is physically and mentally exhausted (on biological level), tired out and has a lot of cortisol in his body due to other reasons as well, is much more prone to "bad romance", ignoring all other details. An "ideally healthy man" doesn't give a f*, or in a worse case just "gives less f*" and get over the struggles faster. The easiest solution is a correction of the body, including brain, by proper simple living protocols for healthy life, natural substances such as food, the well known Mg, K, enough vitamin B, Zinc, repairing a broken metabolism such as diabetic related and insuline resistence, fixing the digestive system and microbiota, building enough of muscle mass and moving enough which helps the sugar metabolism as well, dealing with addictions with the above, all goes with the production of enough of appropriate hormones from all glands; reducing cortisol/stress, which may be one of the core problems.

The work seems to use prediction-misprediction concepts similar to the general notions in ToUM (2001-2004). In Claim #3 in the paper is said: _"Most of our predictions are executed unconsciously. As we saw above, cognitive consciousness (short-term “working memory”) is an extremely limited resource" and  "Multiple unconscious (non-declarative) memory systems exist,"_. Under this definition of consciousness I agree (see above e.g. the match of Y.Bengio's "Consciousness Prior" to ToUM ), however I don't think the activities which are performed more "automatically" are not conscious and I've discussed that both in the classic 2001-2004 works from ToUM and later in the extensive note-articles of the interdisciplinary book "What a man needs? If you play by the rules you'll lose like the fools!", 2014 ("Какво му трябва на човек? Играеш ли по правилата ще загубиш играта!"). There is an article called "Hypothesis about the deeper consciousness". Note #200: https://razumir.twenkid.com/kakvomu_notes.html#200 See also the linked article about the multi-interdisciplinary blindness of the researchers in the AGI field which I criticized in 2013: https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2013/08/issues-on-agiri-agi-email-list-and-agi.html The most of the people are unaware, can't think of, can't analyse, can't distinguish, classify, work with, learn, etc. with  phenomenons, which are trivial and completely obvious and transparent for others who posses the respective talent in music, art, physical, mathematical etc. modalitiy.  The ones who can't understand cannot learn or struggle to learn even the  trivial patterns and activities for the talented or ingenious ones, and at worse they can only follow exact instructions, i.e. without building a deeper internal representation and predictive model covering the the respective modality, only copying the most superficial representation they have access to. 

In the classic works I discuss the paradox that the better one becomes in an art, say an improvising guitarist or any musician, the more "automatic", which in the Yunashki dialect (an extension of Bulgarian which I also developed at the time) it's translated as "humanless" (безчовешко). If it's called "subconscious" that is suggesting that the better and smarter you become, the "dumber" "you" get, if "you" identify yourself with that special "consciousness" that is supposed to be only the current short-term memory, working memory, the declarative memory, or I the biographical memory; it "seems to be" what's associated with "consciousness", some refer to "what can be verbalised", which alone is obviously not correct as one can get a stroke and be aware while having it, also soon she could have his brain severly damaged and still be completely aware of the terrible condition where she got, even though she could never more be able to speak or never to regain the same capacity and lose memory etc. Where "aware" means expressing behaviors which one who does understand what his condition is would be expressing also verbally if he had the capacity - we can convey meaning and thoughts without speaking.

The "default" accepted view of consciousness, the consciousness experience of either the "deeper ones" who can see and cause, produce the finest details and patterns in the images, text, sound, music and motion, and the "shallow ones" for whom music is just "magical" or art is "beautiful" (but they don't understand the gradients, lights, proportions, angles etc., or don't understand the references and the metaphors and don't know or remember the stories behind the scene, don't imagine what's next etc. ), is about that short-term memory, working memory etc., but it doesn't take into account that the content of the "deeper minds" is richer and it has more detailed, structured and Will/Causally linked cognitive representations, more powerful predictive models. That's linked also to the short note https://razumir.twenkid.com/kakvomu_notes.html#267 about the free will according to Engels and https://razumir.twenkid.com/kakvomu_notes.html#269 about two types of personalities regarding the capability to understand, to cognize, and the preferences and gross praise of the "emotions" often seen in people who often fail to understand - have a more shallow consciousness.

The #210 article-note discusses also the dichotomy of apodictic and discoursive cognition, an old classification from philosophy, which seems unknown to modern AI researchers, cognitive scientists and psychologists so they rediscovered it by the so called "System 1" and "System 2", Daniel Kahneman's model. The Note#210 doesn't mention that new nomenclature, as I was unaware of it at the time, but it discusses the fluidity of the border of these systems. In general a more advanced system compresses and predicts in less steps or in one step what a less developed one does in many steps. It is a degree and it is present in technology as well, for example the development of computers and their CPU and software. The simple CPUs such as 6502 need many instructions for a multiplication (except simple ones to powers of 2 - shifts) or for addition of 16-bit numbers, it was "discoursive" for their architecture, but even another 8-bit CPU Z80 or 8088/8086 had multiplication as a single instruction, or "System 1". One of the claims, predictions in #210 is that the machine could learn "to box by a book", unlike humans, because it could have "practically a symmetric connection between the individual-singular-specific and the general concepts [unlike humans, where the abstract concepts carry very little specific information that cannot be reconstructed - humans are very poor in recreating images for example]" (...)
